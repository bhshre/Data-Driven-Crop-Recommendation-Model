# ðŸŒ¾ Data-Driven Crop Recommendation Model

##  Objective

This project presents a **machine learning-based crop recommendation system** that predicts the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and weather conditions. The model is deployed using **Streamlit** for easy local use.

---

##  Problem Statement

Farmers often face difficulty choosing the right crop based on soil and climate. This project helps solve that problem using a trained ML model that takes input parameters like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to suggest the best crop.

---

## Features

- Trained Random Forest machine learning model
- Input interface for farmers via Streamlit
- Instant crop recommendation
-  Local deployment using Python
-  Lightweight and beginner-friendly
